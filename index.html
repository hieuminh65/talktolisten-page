        <h2>Why we need it?</h2>

        <p class="subtitle">Every great app begins by solving a real-world problem </p>
        <p>Think about those times when you're alone and yearning to hear a familiar voice, like your mom's or a faraway lover but there is timezone difference </p>
        <p>Or those restless nights when you just need someone to talk to, someone who understands you deeply, both your strengths and your weaknesses, and then go to sleep </p>
        <p>If you're shy or just need a comforting conversation, imagine having someone who knows you well and can chat with you anytime</p>
        <p>With Talk To Listen, you can have a companion with you anywhere, anytime — whether you're cooking, walking, chilling, ....</p>
